abstract: 'Plant sensing plays an important role in modern smart agriculture and the farming industry. Remote radio sensing allows for monitoring essential indicators of plant health, such as leaf water content (WC). While recent studies have shown the potential of using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for plant sensing, many overlook crucial factors, such as leaf structure and surface roughness, which can impact the accuracy of the measurements. In this article, we introduce Leafeon, which leverages mmWave radar to measure leaf WC noninvasively. Utilizing electronic beam steering, multiple leaf perspectives are sent to a custom deep neural network, which discerns unique reflection patterns from subtle antenna variations, ensuring accurate and robust leaf WC estimations. We implement a prototype of Leafeon using a Commercial Off-The-Shelf mmWave radar and evaluate its performance with a variety of different leaf types. Leafeon was trained in-lab using high-resolution destructive leaf measurements, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of leaf WC as low as 3.17% for the Avocado leaf, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches with an MAE reduction of up to 55.7%. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on live plants in both indoor and glasshouse experimental farm environments. Our results showed a strong correlation between predicted leaf WC levels and drought events.'
